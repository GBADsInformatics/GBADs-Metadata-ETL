# World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) Data 

The World Organization for Animal Health (WOAH) provided livestock population data to GBADs.

Currently, the data does not include metadata. Therefore, we had to create our own descriptive metadata.

For temporal and spatial range, the data was extracted from the data tables that were provided. In addition, we can extract the species from the database tables.
