# Indonesia Data

## Indonesia Central Statistics Agency Livestock Population Data

## Extract Data

All data is from: https://www.bps.go.id/

Given the permissions and language constraints in the Indonesia API documentation, data was manually downloaded 
from the website. 

For the purposes of this exercise we only extracted data for years 2020-2022.

When downloading the data through the dynamic table builder function the data download is not in english - therefore data was downlaoded for 2020-2022 however data is available from 2000: https://www.bps.go.id/id/statistics-table?subject=519#subjekViewTab3
